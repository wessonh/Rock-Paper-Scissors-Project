Rock, Paper, Scissors - CSS 

This is the HTML file for my Rock, Paper, Scissors program. 
It handles the HTML layout and calls the style sheet and the JavaScript file
*/

This program that uses JavaScript and HTML to simulate a rock, paper, scissors game. It is
now contained in the styled HTML page rather than a prompt window. The game uses svg images
for the move buttons. The program now has starting view where the user must press start to begin
the game. There is a hover state for all the buttons in the game. There is also a click state
to let the user know when a button is selected. The user must then select the play hand button
before the timer runs out to make a choice. If the play hand button is selected the user
must unclick it to choose a different move. The user can also unclick the move they selected if
they want if the play hand button is unselected. If the user doesn't move a choice and confirm it
with play hand, the computer randomly chooses for them. The computer also randomly makes its move.
The results are dispalyed and then the play hand button is replaced with a play again button.
The user cant make a move after the timer runs out until the play again button is clicked and the
game resets. 

Extra Credit: The program keeps track of ties, player score, and computer score over multiple games.
The game has a timer that displays rock, paper, scissors, shoot, two seconds for each word. If the user doesn't make a choice
the game chooses for them. Must confirm choice with play hand.
